EXCERCISE 6:
a)
f_name and l_name are private members of base class so that these attributes of a person are inaccesible to derived classes and they can controlled through proper geters and setters 
and age attribute id protected so that derived classes can have direct access to it.

b)
Error	1	error C2248: 'person::f_name' : cannot access private member declared in class 'person'
Error	2	error C2248: 'person::l_name' : cannot access private member declared in class 'person'

c)Why did you get this error?
we get this error because the f_name and l_name are private members of the parent class and in inheritance private members are hidden in derived classes
that's why f_name and l_name are not accesible in student(derived) class.

EXCERCISE 8:
when we change inheritance type from public to protected, there was no effect on working of the code.

EXCERCISE 9:
After changing inheritance type to private there was no effect on working of code as in private inheritance public and protected members become private in derived classes 
and private members of a class can be accessed through a function and code id working without any error.
